# 15 Puzzle Search Algorithms

This project was done for a second year curricular unit (InteligÃªncia Artificial).

Using Python, I implemented a series of search algorithms to better solve the 15 puzzle!<br>
Further rules about the game can be read here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle

The search algorithms implemented were:
- IDFS
- BFS
- DFS
- GREEDY
- A*
